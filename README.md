# X (Twitter) Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning 📝

A Machine Learning project that performs **Sentiment Analysis** on text data. The model classifies the sentiments into **Positive**or **Negative**. It includes data preprocessing, vectorization, model building, evaluation, and comparison using different ML algorithms.

## 🚀 Features

- Clean and preprocess raw text data.
- Convert text into numerical form using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**.
- Train multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Evaluate models using **accuracy score**, **classification report**, and **confusion matrix**.
- Compare performance of the algorithms visually.
